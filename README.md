## Why blockr?

`{blockr}` is an R package designed to democratize data analysis by
providing a flexible, intuitive, and **code-free** approach to building
data pipelines.

## Who is it for?

`{blockr}` has 2 main user targets:

1.  On the one hand, it empowers **non technical** users to create
    insightful data workflows using pre-built blocks that can be
    **easily** connected, all without writing a single line of code.

Below is a simple pre-built case study involving `{blockr}`. We use the
palmerpenguins dataset to find out which femal species has the largest
flippers. This tiny dashboard is composed of 4 steps: import the data,
filter, create the plot and chose the geometry (points). Within each
step (block), the user can change inputs and see the changes propagate
in real time. Notice that the filter step requires to press a submit
button before moving forward, which prevents the plot from appearing
first. This is to prevent long running task from being run unecessarily.
You can find more in other vignettes.

</p>

</div>

You can of course start with a totally empty dashboard and create your
own analysis from scratch.

2.  On the other hand, it provides **developers** with a set of tools to
    seamlessly create new blocks, thereby enhancing the entire framework
    and fostering **collaboration** within organizations teams. For
    instance, regarding the previous example, below is what it takes to
    create such dashboard.

``` r
library(blockr)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggplot2)

new_ggplot_block <- function(col_x = character(), col_y = character(), ...) {

  data_cols <- function(data) colnames(data)

  new_block(
    fields = list(
      x = new_select_field(col_x, data_cols, type = "name"),
      y = new_select_field(col_y, data_cols, type = "name")
    ),
    expr = quote(
      ggplot(mapping = aes(x = .(x), y = .(y)))
    ),
    class = c("ggplot_block", "plot_block"),
    ...
  )
}

new_geompoint_block <- function(color = character(), shape = character(), ...) {

  data_cols <- function(data) colnames(data$data)

  new_block(
    fields = list(
      color = new_select_field(color, data_cols, type = "name"),
      shape = new_select_field(shape, data_cols, type = "name")
    ),
    expr = quote(
      geom_point(aes(color = .(color), shape = .(shape)), size = 2)
    ),
    class = c("plot_layer_block", "plot_block"),
    ...
  )
}

stack <- new_stack(
  data_block = new_dataset_block("penguins", "palmerpenguins"),
  filter_block = new_filter_block("sex", "female"),
  plot_block = new_ggplot_block("flipper_length_mm", "body_mass_g"),
  layer_block = new_geompoint_block("species", "species")
)
serve_stack(stack)
```

Note that the `{blockr.ggplot2}`
[package](https://github.com/BristolMyersSquibb/blockr.ggplot2) exposes
some ready to use blocks as shown above.

## How to get started?

To get started, we invite you to read this
[vignette](https://bristolmyerssquibb.github.io/blockr/articles/blockr.html).

To get a better idea of `{blockr}` capabilities in various data context,
you can look at this
[vignette](https://bristolmyerssquibb.github.io/blockr/articles/blockr_examples.html).

## Key features

1.  **User-Friendly Interface**: Build data pipelines with intuitive
    interface.
2.  **Flexibility**: Easily add, remove, or rearrange blocks in your
    pipeline.
3.  **Extensibility**: Developers can create custom blocks to extend
    functionality.
4.  **Reproducibility**: Pipelines created with `blockr` are easily
    shareable and reproducible, with exportable code.
5.  **Interactivity**: Real-time feedback as you build and modify your
    pipeline.

## Installation

You can install the development version of blockr from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
pak::pak("BristolMyersSquibb/blockr")
```

## Contribute

Easiest is to run `make`, otherwise:

1.  Install npm dependencies with `packer::npm_install()`
2.  Build CSS by running the script in `dev/sass.R`
