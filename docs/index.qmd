## Build data workflows without coding

**blockr** is a block-based framework for data manipulation and visualization that lets you create powerful data workflows through a visual, point-and-click interfaceâ€”**no coding required**.

## For Non-Coders
If you're new to R or don't know how to code, you're in the right place! blockr is designed for you. Check out our [Getting Started](getting-started.qmd) guide and [Block Showcase](showcase/dplyr.qmd) to see what you can do.

## What is blockr?

blockr is a unified meta-package that brings together five core packages:

- **blockr.core** - The foundation framework
- **blockr.dplyr** - Data wrangling blocks (filter, select, summarize, etc.)
- **blockr.ggplot** - Visualization blocks for creating plots
- **blockr.ui** - User interface components
- **blockr.io** - File input/output blocks

Together, these packages provide everything you need to:

- ðŸ“Š Load data from files (CSV, Excel, and more)
- ðŸ”§ Transform and filter data visually
- ðŸ“ˆ Create beautiful visualizations
- ðŸ’¾ Export results to files or reports

## How it works

Instead of writing code, you work with **blocks**:

1. **Add blocks** to your workspace by clicking
2. **Connect blocks** together to create a data pipeline
3. **Configure blocks** using dropdowns, checkboxes, and input fields
4. **See results** in real-time as you build

Each block performs a specific task (like filtering data or creating a plot), and blocks can be chained together to create complex workflows.

## Quick Example

Here's what a typical blockr workflow looks like:

```
[Read CSV] â†’ [Filter Rows] â†’ [Select Columns] â†’ [Create Plot] â†’ [Export]
```

Each step is represented by a visual block with an intuitive interface. No code needed!

## Explore the Showcase

See what you can build with blockr:

- [**Data Wrangling Blocks**](showcase/dplyr.qmd) - Filter, select, transform, and summarize data
- [**File I/O Blocks**](showcase/io.qmd) - Read and write files in multiple formats

## Get Started in 2 Steps

Getting blockr up and running is incredibly simple. If you have R installed, you can start using blockr in just two commands:

**Step 1: Install blockr**
```r
pak::pak("BristolMyersSquibb/blockr")
```

**Step 2: Launch blockr**
```r
blockr::run_app()
```

That's it! The blockr interface will open in your browser, and you can start building workflows immediately.

## New to R?
Even if you're not familiar with R, these two commands are all you need. Just copy and paste them into the R console. See the [Getting Started](getting-started.qmd) guide for more details.

## Core Packages

blockr is built on five specialized packages that work together:

- [blockr.core](https://bristolmyerssquibb.github.io/blockr.core/) - Framework and architecture
- [blockr.dplyr](https://bristolmyerssquibb.github.io/blockr.dplyr/) - Data manipulation blocks
- [blockr.ggplot](https://bristolmyerssquibb.github.io/blockr.ggplot/) - Plotting and visualization
- [blockr.ui](https://bristolmyerssquibb.github.io/blockr.ui/) - User interface components
- [blockr.io](https://bristolmyerssquibb.github.io/blockr.io/) - File reading and writing

Installing blockr automatically installs all five packages, giving you the complete toolkit.
