## Build data workflows without coding

blockr is a block-based framework for data manipulation and visualization. It provides a visual, point-and-click interface for creating data workflows without writing code.

## What is blockr?

blockr is a unified meta-package that brings together five core packages:

- blockr.core - The foundation framework
- blockr.dplyr - Data wrangling blocks (filter, select, summarize, etc.)
- blockr.ggplot - Visualization blocks for creating plots
- blockr.ui - User interface components
- blockr.io - File input/output blocks

These packages let you load data from files, transform and filter data, create visualizations, and export results.

## How it works

Instead of writing code, you work with blocks:

1. Add blocks to your workspace
2. Connect blocks together to create a data pipeline
3. Configure blocks using dropdowns, checkboxes, and input fields
4. View results in real-time as you build

Each block performs a specific task (filtering data, creating a plot, etc.) and can be chained together to create workflows.

## Example workflow

```{mermaid}
%%| echo: false
flowchart LR
    A[Read CSV] --> B[Filter Rows]
    B --> C[Select Columns]
    C --> D[Create Plot]
    D --> E[Export]
```

## Blocks

See available blocks and what they do:

- [Data Wrangling Blocks](showcase/dplyr.qmd) - Filter, select, transform, and summarize data
- [Data Visualization Blocks](showcase/ggplot.qmd) - Create scatter plots, bar charts, line charts, and more
- [File I/O Blocks](showcase/io.qmd) - Read and write files in multiple formats

## Getting Started

To install and run blockr, see the [Getting Started](getting-started.qmd) guide.

## Core Packages

blockr is built on five specialized packages:

- [blockr.core](https://bristolmyerssquibb.github.io/blockr.core/) - Framework and architecture
- [blockr.dplyr](https://bristolmyerssquibb.github.io/blockr.dplyr/) - Data manipulation blocks
- [blockr.ggplot](https://bristolmyerssquibb.github.io/blockr.ggplot/) - Plotting and visualization
- [blockr.ui](https://bristolmyerssquibb.github.io/blockr.ui/) - User interface components
- [blockr.io](https://bristolmyerssquibb.github.io/blockr.io/) - File reading and writing

Installing blockr automatically installs all five packages.

## Extending blockr

The five core packages provide base blocks for common data analysis tasks. blockr can be extended with additional block packages for specific domains.

For example, [blockr.ts](https://github.com/cynkra/blockr.ts) adds blocks for time series analysis, including decomposition, forecasting, and frequency analysis.

Additional block packages can be installed separately and will integrate seamlessly with the blockr interface.
