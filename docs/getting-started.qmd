## Installation

Install blockr from GitHub:

```r
pak::pak("BristolMyersSquibb/blockr")
```

This installs all five core packages: blockr.core, blockr.dplyr, blockr.ggplot, blockr.ui, and blockr.io.

## Launching blockr

Run the blockr interface:

```r
blockr::run_app()
```

The interface will open in your web browser.

## Building a workflow

The blockr interface lets you add blocks, connect them together, and configure them using dropdowns and input fields.

### Example: Load, filter, and visualize data

**Add a data source:**
- Click "Add Block"
- Select "Read Block" from the I/O category
- Choose "Upload" mode and upload a CSV file

**Filter the data:**
- Add a "Filter Block" from the Data Wrangling category
- Connect it to the Read Block
- Set filter conditions using the dropdown menus

**Create a visualization:**
- Add a "Plot Block" from the Visualization category
- Select a plot type (scatter plot, bar chart, etc.)
- Choose columns for X and Y axes
- Customize colors and labels

**Export results:**
- Add a "Write Block"
- Choose an output format (PNG, PDF, Excel, etc.)
- Click "Export"

## Explore available blocks

Each showcase demonstrates different block categories:

- [Data Wrangling Blocks](showcase/dplyr.qmd) - Filtering, selecting, transforming, summarizing
- [Data Visualization Blocks](showcase/ggplot.qmd) - Scatter plots, bar charts, line charts, histograms
- [File I/O Blocks](showcase/io.qmd) - Reading and writing various file formats
