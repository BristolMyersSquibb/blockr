## Quick Start

Install:

```r
pak::pak("BristolMyersSquibb/blockr")
```

Run:

```r
blockr::run_app()
```

The blockr interface will open in your web browser. That's it!

::: {.callout-note}
## What does this do?
- `pak::pak()` installs blockr and all five core packages (blockr.core, blockr.dplyr, blockr.ggplot, blockr.ui, blockr.io)
- `blockr::run_app()` launches the visual interface in your browser
- You don't need to know R programming—just copy and paste these commands
:::

## Your First Workflow

Once you've launched blockr with `blockr::run_app()`, you'll see the visual interface in your browser. Let's create a simple data workflow using blocks.

### Step 1: Add a Data Source Block

1. Click "Add Block" in the interface
2. Select "Read Block" from the I/O category
3. Choose "Upload" mode
4. Upload a CSV file from your computer

### Step 3: Add a Filter Block

1. Click "Add Block" again
2. Select "Filter Block" from the Data Wrangling category
3. Connect it to your Read Block
4. Use the dropdown menus to set filter conditions

### Step 4: Add a Visualization Block

1. Add a "Plot Block" from the Visualization category
2. Select the type of plot you want (bar chart, scatter plot, etc.)
3. Choose which columns to use for X and Y axes
4. Customize colors and labels

### Step 5: Export Your Results

1. Add an "Export Block"
2. Choose your output format (PNG, PDF, Excel, etc.)
3. Click "Export" to save your results

## Working with blockr
Remember, blockr is entirely visual—you don't need to write any code once the interface is running. All configuration happens through dropdown menus, checkboxes, and input fields.

## Example Workflows

### Data Wrangling Example

See the [Data Wrangling Showcase](showcase/dplyr.qmd) for detailed examples of:

- Filtering rows based on conditions
- Selecting specific columns
- Creating new calculated columns
- Grouping and summarizing data
- Arranging rows in order

### File I/O Example

The [File I/O Showcase](showcase/io.qmd) demonstrates:

- Reading different file formats (CSV, Excel, etc.)
- Loading data from URLs
- Handling multiple files at once
- Exporting results in various formats

## Next Steps

- **Explore the Showcase**: Browse the [Data Wrangling](showcase/dplyr.qmd) and [File I/O](showcase/io.qmd) showcases to see all available blocks
- **Build Your Own**: Start with your own data and experiment with different blocks
- **Get Help**: If you run into issues, [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/BristolMyersSquibb/blockr/issues)

## Learning Resources

Each showcase page includes screenshots and descriptions of how blocks work. Since blockr is visual and interactive, the best way to learn is by trying it yourself!

## Tip for New Users
Start with simple workflows (1-3 blocks) to get comfortable with the interface. As you become more familiar, you can build more complex multi-step pipelines.
