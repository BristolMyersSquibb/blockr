## Get started

`{blockr}` provides plug and play block which can be used to import, transform and visualize data.

### Introduction

`{blockr}` aims at abstracting the logic behind `{dplyr}` functions
under __blocks__. We assume that a __stack__ is a succession
of dependent blocks. We designed 3 kinds of blocks:

- __data__ block: entry level block to determine input data.
- __transform__ block: materialize `{dplyr}` operations on the selected data.
- __output__ (only plot for now) block: consumes transformed data to produce visualizations.

A __stack__ always starts from a data block and may end either by a transform blocks or an output block.

Note: at the moment, there is only one output block per stack.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
mermaid("
  flowchart TB
    subgraph stack
      input(Data);
      transform(Transform);
      output(Visualize);
      input-->transform--> output;
    end
  ",
  height = "120px"
) |>
  htmlwidgets::onRender(
    "function(el, x) {
      el.classList.add('text-center')
    }
    "
  )
```

### The user interface

By default, only the last __stack__ block is visible, all others are collapsed.
To preview all block you can set `options("BLOCKR_DEV" = TRUE)`.

```{r blockr-ui, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='User Interface Overview', fig.align = 'center', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/blockr-ui.png")
```

### Create a stack

To create a __stack__, you call `new_stack()` and feed it all the required __blocks__.
Below is a simple stack providing a dataset selector and a filter operation. `serve_stack()` is a simple
wrapper to run the corresponding shiny app. Note that with `serve_stack()`, you don't need to worry about
specifying any __modules IDs__, they are automatically handled by `{blockr}`.

```r
library(blockr)
library(blockr.data)

stack <- new_stack(
  dataset_block,
  filter_block
)
serve_stack(stack)
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
card(
  create_app_link(
    "NobwRAdghgtgpmAXGKAHVA6ASmANGAYwHsIAXOMpMAdzgCMAnRRASwgGdSoAbbgCgA6YOtyIEA1gyG4ABAzioi7GQF4ZQgBalSqdogD0+kWMkBaIgwDmGSy1IaArnQwsi+2o1PzF7IQEoBCG4WRigGAE8+YwkGAI4uCRkAHlMZCDhqAH1OKAlBCBlCmQATKC52OFJM6PFcQKKZADMWbnIGatEJQLjAioYANzhshPE+HIk-MABfAF0gA", # nolint
    "app",
    header = FALSE
  ),
  full_screen = TRUE
)
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
note_box(
  "You'll notice that some blocks, such as the `filter_block`
  have a submit button. The reason was to prevent any expansive task
  to run without explicit user approval. That said, this feature is
  still very much experimental and might change in the future.",
  color = "primary"
)
```


In the next example, we'll see how to create an which can dynamically add or remove blocks.

### Dynamically add a block

The stack exposes a helper button to add a block in the top right corner of the card header. 
It triggers an [offcanvas](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/offcanvas/)
UI panel, that basically allows one to select any block available in the 
registered blocks [vignette](https://blockr-org.github.io/blockr/articles/registry.html).

As a side note, there's another mechanism that works to add blocks, which we describe in the
following. It is more verbose but allows you to 
bring your own custom UI. On the UI side, we call `generate_ui()`,
which is nothing more than calling the stack module UI and `generate_server()` in the Shiny server function. If you leave `id` NULL,
the namespace is automatically handled. To get the list of available blocks, we leverage the `{blockr}` registry namely `available_blocks()` which exposes the
currently registered blocks. You can learn more about the registry in the dedicated
[vignette](https://blockr-org.github.io/blockr/articles/registry.html). 
`add_block_ui()` is a UI helper to show a button as well
as the necessary interface to contain the new block choice.
Within an `observer` we listen to the "add block" button. Then, we pass the new block in the `new_block` slot of the `generate_server()` function.
It accepts the name of the block to insert as well as its position in the stack (here we append and leave `NULL`).

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
note_box(
  "Note that `{blockr.demo}` (https://github.com/blockr-org/block.demo)
  utilises `{masonry}` (https://github.com/blockr-org/masonry) to provide
  a better user experience, allowing one to drag and drop blocks
  within the stack.",
  color = "primary"
)
```

```r
library(shiny)
library(blockr)

stack <- new_stack(dataset_block)
shinyApp(
  ui = bslib::page_fluid(
    add_block_ui(),
    generate_ui(stack, id = "mystack")
  ),
  server = function(input, output, session) {
    vals <- reactiveValues(new_block = NULL)
    stack <- generate_server(
      stack,
      id = "mystack",
      new_block = reactive(vals$new_block)
    )

    observeEvent(input$add, {
      block <- available_blocks()[[input$selected_block]]
      # add_block expect the current stack, the block to add and its position
      # (NULL is fine for the position, in that case the block will
      # go at the end)
      vals$new_block <- list(block = block)
    })
  }
)
```

Blocks can be removed in any context. Keep in mind that a stack can't contain 2 data blocks.

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
note_box(
  "At the moment, we don't check whether removing a block breaks the pipeline.",
  color = "danger"
)
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
card(
  create_app_link(
    "NobwRAdghgtgpmAXGKAHVA6ASmANGAYwHsIAXOMpMAdzgCMAnRRASwgGdSoAbbgCgA6YOtyIEA1gyG4ABAzioi7GQF4ZQgBalSqdogD0+kWMkBaIgwDmGSy1IaArnQwsi+2o1PzF7IQEoBCG4WRigGAE8+YwkGAIhAzigJGQAeUxkIOGoAfUSJPjiWABNU9KEYcLzxIUCEjTZw5nZ6iHCAQXRBCBkZBxZVGTp2YLpmVChLOGyAM24+oq6ensnMhihybL6+KtliuJ6-XECe9jgGADczgemHCAJSVwg+NlQHUlkiN9f3mVP2dkefhkIGOSyqpRkKzO6ympwuZ22XAkuyK+xkAF9An4wOiALpAA", # nolint
    "app",
    header = FALSE
  ),
  full_screen = TRUE
)
```

### Example with modules

The stack can be nested within modules. This is what we do in
[`{blockr.demo}`](https://github.com/blockr-org/block.demo).

```r
library(shiny)
library(blockr)

stack <- new_stack(
  dataset_block,
  filter_block,
  select_block
)

block_ui <- function(id) {
  ns <- NS(id)
  generate_ui(stack, id = ns("b"))
}

block_server <- function(id) {
  moduleServer(
    id,
    function(input, output, session){
      ns <- session$ns
      generate_server(stack, id = "b")
    }
  )
}

ui <- function(req) {
  fluidPage(
    theme = bslib::bs_theme(5L),
    div(
      class = "row",
      block_ui("x")
    )
  )
}
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  block_server("x")
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```
